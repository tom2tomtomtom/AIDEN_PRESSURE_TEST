# Appendix: Troubleshooting

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Brief Parsing Incomplete
**Problem:** AI extracts less than expected
**Solution:** Add clear section headers: "Objectives:", "Target Audience:", etc.

### Copy Generation Timeout
**Problem:** Generation seems stuck
**Solution:** Normal - takes 3-5 minutes. Don't refresh. Check progress indicator.

### Persona Responses Unrealistic
**Problem:** Too positive or negative
**Solution:** Adjust skepticism slider:
- Low = Friendly
- Medium = Balanced
- High = Skeptical
- Extreme = Stress test

### WebSocket Drops (AIDEN.chat)
**Problem:** Chat disconnects
**Solution:** Auto-reconnects. Check network stability.

### Phantoms Not Activating
**Problem:** 3D brain shows no activity
**Solution:** Use specific keywords. Phantoms need word/intent/emotion triggers.

### PowerPoint Won't Open
**Problem:** File won't open
**Solution:** Check output folder exists: `~/Presentations/AIDEN/`
